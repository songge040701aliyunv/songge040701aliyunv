### 📝 - Azure Functions/Durable Functions Workshop

I've made a full day workshop for Azure Functions/Durable Functions called [*Building a resilient workflow using Durable Functions*](https://github.com/marcduiker/building-a-resilient-workflow-with-durable-functions). 

I've given this workshop several times, both as in-person classroom training as well as remote. Contact [Xpirit](https://www.xpirit.com/) or myself if you want me to do this workshop for your organization.
